# Medianajones
Compare Mediainfo details for videos; find similarities in an array of videos. Handy as a debugging tool in case you're wondering why some videos are acting strange in some other context.


### prerequisites:
    1. sudo apt-get install mediainfo
    2. pip install pymediainfo


### how to:
    1. add your videos to the ALL_FILES array
    2. consider whether you want to include "not in common" details or not (can be handy for context; can be annoying if you don't care)
    3. run it damn it
